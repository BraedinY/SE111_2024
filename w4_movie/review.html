            <h2>Review of The Movie<em> White House Down</em> (2013)</h2>

            <p>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</p>

            <p><b>Braedin Yarletts</b>, <i>January 30, 2024</i></p>

            <p><em>White House Down</em> was one of my favorite action packed movies probably of all time. The movie is a well directed simulation of the White House being under act and the posabilities and the secnarios that could come with it. Not only did this movie have action packed scenes but I loved that they put a little comdey here and there to make the movie even more enjoyable. Putting Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx as the two main character was a great decision I really enjoyed seeing them both in the same movie. I would totally recommend people that love action movies with a little comdey, great movie overall.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Not only was the Movie filmed in Washington D.C. but was mostly filmed in Monteral!</li>
                    <li>Believe it or not this film was actually not based on a true story</li>
                    <li>As you can see in the trailer, this isn't a small movie.  As I learned on set, the production re-created 65% of the White House and they didn't do it on the cheap. </li>
